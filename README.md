# Music-Quiz---Simple-Python-Game
This is a basic game created in Year 10, which explores loops, logic and user inputs.

**How to run:**
As there are no external PIPs or libraries needed, the code can be pasted into a version of python, or a public IDE such as replit.

**What I learned:**
- Gained a basic understanding of selection statements, iterations and file handling
- Learned to utilise subroutines

**Future improvements:**
- Could include classes to create questions
- Increase the number of questions available for users
- Create a way for users to easily access the scores file
